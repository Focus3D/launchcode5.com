An open position on your team is an opportunity to reinforce the virtues that you want your staff to demonstrate on a daily basis. Who you select to fill a position sends a message to the rest of your organization about the traits and behaviours that management truly values, regardless of what you tell new hires or have written in employee handbooks and documentation. When it comes to promotions <b>*actions speak louder than words*</b>. Select the right candidate and you are demonstrating to your staff what sort of behaviours the organization rewards. Select the wrong candidate and your are letting your staff know what failings will be overlooked.

Hopefully, you've got someone in mind that you'd like to promote because they're hard-working, an excellent collaborator, well-liked by their peers, ethical, knowledgeable and share credit for their many professional achievements with their co-workers. Unfortunately, there are many poor reasons that frequently lead to the promotion of an individual. 

If you have a candidate you are considering for promotion, make sure your reasoning doesn't fall into any of these traps:

<div>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li><b>Promotion Reason Trap #1: They produce great work or get results in their current position</b>
    <p>While no one should be held back from advancement because they are achieving excellent results in their current role, you must ensure that they have the right skills for the open position. An excellent developer or designer could make for terrible manager. If they are driven by a strong competitive streak, prefer to work independently or have a difficult time sharing credit with their peers, you should find other ways to reward their continued achievements. If, on the other hand, their current success is driven by soft skills such as collaboration, taking the best of others' ideas or getting the most from the junior staff they work with, they may be an excellent candidate for the position.</p></li> 

    <li><b>Trap #2: You are having trouble filling the position</b>
    <p>Don't rush to put someone in the role because you're worried about leaving it vacant: Much more damage can be done by making a poor choice than by waiting. Instead, take advantage of the vacancy to get your team to pull together while you find a suitable candidate. You may find that someone within your team that you hadn't initially considered will demonstrate skills they hadn't previously had the opportunity to demonstrate.</p> 
   </li>
    
   <li><b>Trap #3: They've been loyal to you, or they tow the company line</b>
   <p>All too frequently, poor managers promote friends or those that have enabled their own continued employment as a way of either rewarding their loyalty, or assuring they have allies in key positions to help hide their own failings. These managers aren't leaders. Similarly, dysfunctional organizations' policies or decisions may frequently be questioned by staff members and you may be tempted to promote a team member that tows the line and helps quash dissent. In either case, other employees will see this kind of promotion for what it is and proceeding with it will damage the culture you are trying to develop. Both of these motivations point to personal or organizational failings that should be carefully examined and addressed.</p>
   </li>

    <li><b>Trap #4: They've put their time in</b>
    <p>Experienced employees frequently have the benefit of developing a deep understanding of an organization's products, business processes and clients. They will often have developed soft-skills that strengthen their abilities to collaborate with and mentor other staff. They may be relied upon for advice when teammates encounter technical or professional challenges. If these statements match your candidate and they produce quality work, then absolutely they should be considered: This kind of wisdom should be valued within an organization. Tenure alone, on the other hand, should not.</p>
   </li>

    <li><b>Trap #5: They are interested in the position, and you are worried they may leave if they don't get it</b>
    <p>Retaining talented staff is critical to the success of any company & often a talented employee will believe that they deserve consideration for a particular role or promotion, particularly in organizations that tie pay rate to organizational hierarchy. If you aren't sure that they're right or ready for the role, then be clear with them about how they currently fit into the team and what skills they need to improve for further consideration. To help prevent this kind of issue from arising in the future, ensure that team member's contributions are regularly acknowledged, that they are they are fairly compensated for the value they provide to your organization, rather than where they fit into a pecking order, and that everyone understands that if they currently fill a niche or senior technical role, a promotion could mean a pay CUT and not an increase.</p>
   </li>

    <li><b>Trap #6: They've demanded the position and threatened to leave</b>
    <p>Hopefully an employee never brings you an ultimatum demanding a promotion or a self-serving organizational change. If it does happen, however, realize that this individual is demonstrating the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Either a profound lack of confidence in your analytic and decision-making skills or a lack of confidence in their own suitability for the role, and...
    <li>A lack of consideration for the other members of their team
    </ul>
    <br />
    Let them know the transgression that they've made, and what they have demonstrated to you.
    </p>
   </li>
</ul>
</div>

If you've been considering someone for a promotion and you haven't fallen into any of the traps listed above, but you still have some reservations about the candidate, ask yourself the following: <b>Are any of your candidate's weaknesses complementary to the strengths that you or the new team possess?</b> Are these issues that only need a little polish or are they major flaws? If you or the team are strong in these areas and they aren't major flaws in the person's work ethic or character, then with a little coaching/mentoring and a strong team, you're probably in good stead. 

With your successful candidate selected, ensure to take the time to make a proper announcement. Reinforce your ethos by running through each of the values that you are trying to nurture within your organization and site examples of how your candidate meets or exceeds those expectations. Then get everyone back to work.
