It's tough to manage what you don't understand and in a world where the ubiquity of technology is ever-increasing, the necessity for code literacy has never been more important. Whether or not your job function involves coding is no longer relevant. Programming has become an essential skill.

      “In the emerging, highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the software or you will be the software. It’s really that simple: Program, or be programmed.”

      - Douglas Rushkoff

Does this mean that you should be able to build your own websites and apps? No, of course not. You've got plenty of options like hiring a web development shop like [Launchcode Studios](http://www.launchcode5.com) or building your own team of developers. However, having an understanding of the basic fundamentals of programming will enable you to communicate better with your development team and appreciate what features and changes should be minor efforts and what should be major.

The ability to rapidly build your product while continuously iterating over the feature set is vital for an early-stage start up. Being flexible, nimble, and humble enough to listen to the feedback of your customers are key ingredients for building a meaningful and useful product. The challenge, however, is being able to build a product quickly, cheaply, and of high quality. The golden rule of the [Project Management Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_triangle) is that you can only choose two out of the three. For example, you could build a product quickly and cheaply but the code may not be re-usable. You end up taking on technical debt. Unfortunately, developers are all bred from the family of Lannisters, and as the saying goes, "A Lannister always pays his debts". As a leader, you'll be able to better understand the tradeoffs your team is making and the impacts they have if you have some programming experience under your belt.

Another benefit of improving your code literacy is gaining the ability to set realistic timelines and goals. While hustling, pushing boundaries and challenging your team to strive for more is inherently weaved into the fabric of a startup's DNA, you don't want to leave your team burnt out. It's important to set relatively realistic timelines.

Let's say you thought of a new feature that could really improve your product offering. You think it’s a relatively simple feature to build, so you give your development team a week to complete the task. Your developers push back explaining the potential challenges ahead. You can't quite empathize because you don't understand the issues they're foreseeing. Instead, you go full steam ahead and start promising clients that they’ll be able to use your latest and greatest feature within a week. As it turns out, the feature takes a month to build. While your developers are stressed and exhausted, you're left disappointed and embarrassed, scrambling to regain the patience and trust of your customers. This disastrous scenario could be avoided if you were better equipped to understand potential development constraints.

Of course, there are scenarios where you aren't the "bad buy". You ask your freelance developer to update all the copy on your landing page with the new version that you've provide him. You also ask him to tweak the colour of some of the buttons on your site. The developer quotes you a week's worth of development time to complete the task. You might think, “He *is* updating the copy for the entire page after all. I guess a week sounds fairly reasonable”. Wrong. Unless an unexpected ice storm came sweeping through his neighbourhood leaving his home powerless for the week, this type of request typically shouldn't take that long. Don't let your lack of technical knowledge be taken advantage of. Stepping up your programming game will help you overcome some of these challenges.

You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Your developers will have a greater respect for you and having an understanding of the architecture and data structures for your own application will empower you to recognize what's practical in your application and what's not. You’ll be more effective in your role by having the foresight of potential roadblocks in the development process and accounting for them. You'll be more efficient and so will your team.

Convinced? Awesome. So, where should you start? There is a plethora of amazing free resources on the Internet. I’ll be going over some of my top favourite resources in my next post. Stay tuned!
