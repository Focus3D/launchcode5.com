Today we are introducing the Launchcode5 Blogs.

Launchcode5 Software Studios is a collaborative team of designers, developers, solution architects and product and project managers with a wide range of experience and skills.

In the pages of our blog, our contributors will discuss many of the skills and strategies that we've seen lead organizations to successful projects, happy clients, happy teams and high levels of both client and employee retention. Wherever possible, we'll contrast those strategies with failed approaches that we've witnessed or even been a part of.

In our collective experiences, the most challenging aspects of building a successful technology company are rarely the technical obstacles, but rather the often over-looked challenges of team-building, processes & process management, internal and external communications and defining clear expectations and objectives for individuals, the organization and clients. While these sorts of issues don't necessarily make for the sexiest topics, attention to these sorts details and the proper handling of them builds a strong foundation for the success of the organization as a whole and for it's projects.

That isn't to say that we'll ignore technology - our team is eager to write about the technologies that they are using, the challenges they encounter and the solutions they develop to them.

Our main blog, accessible through [launchcode5.com](http://www.launchcode5.com), will be divided into four sub-blogs:

    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><b>Team Building & Management</b>
            <p>This blog will focus on the challenges of building and maintaining a talented and satisfied cross-disciplinary team, one that's able to successfully balance life and work and is driven to go the extra mile for customers and each other.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Technology & Development</b>
            <p>Our technology and development blog will focus on the tools we are using, issues we've encountered, the solutions to those issues and, most importantly, stuff that's just plain fun.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Business and Development Processes</b>
            <p>In our Business and Development Processes blog, we'll discuss challenges that we've encountered (or witnessed) in the development of enterprises and supportable products. This is the place where you might find us discussing when change control may or may not be needed, the pros and cons of accepting investor capital, or the value of incubators, industry conventions, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Launchcode5 News</b>
            <p>Finally, in the Launchcode5 News blog, you'll find us discussing new projects, posting new positions, welcoming new staff or announcing community events.  </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
