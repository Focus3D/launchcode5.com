Brains & experience
--------------------------------------

There's a careful balance to be had in bringing along promising young staff...

We want to be sure to continue to build their skills and to do so quickly, while also helping them build social and team skills and to learn the value of experience in handling problems.

These goals run counter to each other - bringing them along quickly doesn't help build any of that sort of respect, but stifling their development won't either.

Think about Marc, Travis and Aleks. What went wrong there and what could have been made better.

Think about Ernest and his over-the-top approach and how that was too much.

Think about Fairooz and Cigdem and how well they were coming along working with the team.

Junior staff will find mentors/senior staff to model themselves after, even in the absence of good models.

Junior/young staff will make social and interpersonal mistakes that can harm your team, cost you other staff.
Poorly rounded staff that are promoted create a mould for other Junior staff to model themselves after, creating a perpetual machine of flawed staff.

Junior staff need values to be developed within them - they need examples of peers being promoted for being not only productive, but good teammates, demonstrating patience, etc.
