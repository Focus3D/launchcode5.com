With that in mind, Launchcode5 has been founded with seven guiding principles that each of us is expected to uphold: </p>

                                <p>While we are committed to developing projects using widely-adopted technologies that meet the needs of our clients, we actively encourage our team members to dedicate time to experimenting with new technologies, to blog about them, to contribute to or develop their own open-source projects and to share their experiences with their peers.</p>

                                <p>In a highly competitive environment, it is easy for individuals and organizations to cut corners, to make exceptions or to act slightly unethically to get a client's signature on a contract, position themselves for a bonus or promotion, or recruit their newest employee.</p>
                                <p>All too frequently, organizations view ethics and honesty as a grey scale instead of black and white, through the lens of what is and is not legal or what they can or cannot get away with.</p>
                                <p>We expect every member of our staff to be a beacon to their team, our company to to our clients and that any time we cut a corner, use wiggle words, exaggerate our capabilities or do anything else that is even slightly unethical, they will all take note.</p>
